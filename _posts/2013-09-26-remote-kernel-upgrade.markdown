Remotely upgrading a kernel without some sort of remote KVM solution is not for the faint hearted. Realizing you forgot to include some module, or build the initrd image after remotely rebooting a kernel is even worse ;)

Luckily there are some nice tricks you can use to make a remote kernel upgrade as safe as possible.
