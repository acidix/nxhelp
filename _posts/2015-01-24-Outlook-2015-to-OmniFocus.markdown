title: Integrating Outlook 2015 and OmniFocus
---
Ever since Microsoft decided to honor the latest changes to the way Mac Apps are built (read: Sandboxing) it's been painful to integrate it to other apps. For me, the most crucial integration is with OmniFocus for task management. The fact that MS seems to be ditching AppleScript support - at least for new features - and completely removed the scripts menu doesn't help either.

Yesterday I came across a comment by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com) on [Rainer Burgstaller's](http://rainer.4950.net/) site (author of one of the best Outlook-to-OmniFocus scripts as well as FocusGTD, a great way to use OF on Android) that described what location needs to be used in order to comply to sandboxing regulations and still be able to save a copy of the message alongside the task in OmniFocus.

All credit for this edit goes to Rainer & Brett, I was just pressing the keys - no brain work involved :) Here's the script, together with some comments on the [original post](http://rainer.4950.net/2014/06/04/outlook-to-omnifocus2-take-12/): (https://www.dropbox.com/s/og7ysjf7mc85kx1/Outlook2015-2-OmniFocus.scpt?dl=0)
